# Arkanoid Game

### About the game
Arkanoid is a known block breaker arcade game.  
Using the paddle that appears at the bottom of the screen, the player is asked to clear a set of colored blocks that appear on the screen by deflecting a ball towards it, without letting the balls leave the bottom edge of the playfield.  
Each level has its own unique arrangement of blocks, background, paddle size and speed, balls size, balls speed, balls amount and more.  

### Gaining points
With every block you destroy, you gain a little amount of points. When all the blocks on the playground are destroyed, you gain a bunch of points and also move to the next level.
If you managed to pass all four levels, you won. If all the balls managed to slip to the bottom of the playground, you lost. Either way, your last score is shown on the screen.  

### Controlling the game 
You can control the paddle with the left and right arrows on yoour keyboard. When a ball hits the paddle, it bounces back to the playground. Notice that the velocity and direction of the ball are changed depending on where the paddle was hit.
